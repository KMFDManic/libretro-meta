# libretro-meta

The idea of this repo is to offer ONE place to report issues, and also to keep the cores at a "STABLE" commit so we can provide stable cores in the future. This would be achieved via submodules.

Issues can be copied using this application, and once it's done the original issue trackers can be disabled.
